description: "Beasts and Super-Beasts is a collection of short stories, written by\
  \ Saki (the literary pseudonym of Hector Hugh Munro) and first published in 1914.\
  \ The title parodies that of George Bernard Shaw's Man and Superman.\nAlong with\
  \ The Chronicles of Clovis, Beasts and Super-Beasts is one of Saki's best-known\
  \ works. It was his final collection of stories before his death in World War I,\
  \ and several of its stories, in particular \"The Open Window\", are reprinted frequently\
  \ in anthologies.\nThe majority of the volume's stories deal in some fashion with\
  \ animals, providing the source for its title. The character of Clovis Sangrail,\
  \ featured in earlier works by Saki, appears in several stories. Most of the stories\
  \ appeared previously in periodicals.\nStylistically, Beasts and Super-Beasts displays\
  \ the simple language, cynicism and wry humor that characterize Saki's earlier literary\
  \ output.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
